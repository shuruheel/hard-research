# Artifacts System

The artifacts system allows for the creation and display of various content types (text, code, images, sheets) within the application.

## Core Components

- **Artifact Component**: [components/artifact.tsx](mdc:components/artifact.tsx) - Main component for displaying artifacts
- **Artifact State Management**: [hooks/use-artifact.ts](mdc:hooks/use-artifact.ts) - Hook for managing artifact state

## Artifact Types

The system supports multiple artifact types, each with its own implementation:

- **Text**: 
  - Client: [artifacts/text/client.ts](mdc:artifacts/text/client.ts)
  - Server: [lib/artifacts/text/server.ts](mdc:lib/artifacts/text/server.ts)
- **Code**: 
  - Client: [artifacts/code/client.ts](mdc:artifacts/code/client.ts)
  - Server: [lib/artifacts/code/server.ts](mdc:lib/artifacts/code/server.ts)
- **Image**: 
  - Client: [artifacts/image/client.ts](mdc:artifacts/image/client.ts)
  - Server: [lib/artifacts/image/server.ts](mdc:lib/artifacts/image/server.ts)
- **Sheet**: 
  - Client: [artifacts/sheet/client.ts](mdc:artifacts/sheet/client.ts)
  - Server: [lib/artifacts/sheet/server.ts](mdc:lib/artifacts/sheet/server.ts)

## Artifact Actions

Common artifact actions are defined in:
- [artifacts/actions.ts](mdc:artifacts/actions.ts)

## Integration with Research System

The artifacts system is used to display research results from the deep research system. The research orchestrator creates artifacts to present comprehensive research findings to the user.
