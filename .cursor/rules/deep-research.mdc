# Deep Research System

The deep research system implements an orchestrator-worker pattern for comprehensive multi-step research. It breaks down complex queries into manageable sub-queries and synthesizes findings.

## Core Components

- **Deep Research Tool**: [lib/ai/tools/deepResearch.ts](mdc:lib/ai/tools/deepResearch.ts) - Main implementation of the research process
- **Research Orchestrator**: [lib/ai/agents/researchOrchestrator.ts](mdc:lib/ai/agents/researchOrchestrator.ts) - Orchestrates the research process
- **Web Search Worker**: [lib/ai/tools/webSearchWorker.ts](mdc:lib/ai/tools/webSearchWorker.ts) - Handles web search functionality
- **Semantic Retrieval**: [lib/ai/tools/semanticRetrieval.ts](mdc:lib/ai/tools/semanticRetrieval.ts) - Provides semantic search against Neo4j knowledge graph

## Research Flow

1. Break down main query into focused sub-queries
2. For each sub-query:
   - Query knowledge graph for relevant information
   - Perform web search for additional context
   - Process information and extract key findings
3. Synthesize final comprehensive answer from all results

## Integration with UI

The research results are displayed as artifacts in the UI. This is handled by:

- [components/artifact.tsx](mdc:components/artifact.tsx) - Main artifact display component
- [hooks/use-artifact.ts](mdc:hooks/use-artifact.ts) - Hook for managing artifact state

## API Integration

The deep research functionality is integrated in the chat API route:
[app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts](mdc:app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts)
