# Agents in AI SDK

## Overview

Agents are AI systems designed to "understand context and take meaningful actions" by combining different capabilities and workflows. The key is finding the right balance between flexibility and control.

## Building Blocks

### 1. Single-Step LLM Generation
- Basic building block
- Single call to an LLM for straightforward tasks like classification or text generation

### 2. Tool Usage
- Extends LLM capabilities through tools like calculators, APIs, or databases
- Can make multiple tool calls across multiple steps
- Controlled way to expand LLM functionality

### 3. Multi-Agent Systems
- Multiple LLMs working together
- Each specialized for different aspects of complex tasks
- Enables sophisticated behaviors while maintaining component focus

## Workflow Patterns

1. **Sequential Processing (Chains)**
   - Steps executed in predefined order
   - Each step's output becomes input for next step
   - Ideal for well-defined sequences

2. **Routing**
   - Model decides workflow path based on context
   - Dynamically adjusts processing approach

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Break tasks into independent subtasks
   - Execute simultaneously to improve efficiency

4. **Orchestrator-Worker**
   - Primary model coordinates specialized workers
   - Each worker optimized for specific subtask

5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**
   - Introduces quality control steps
   - Evaluates intermediate results
   - Can retry or adjust workflow based on assessment

## Multi-Step Tool Usage with OpenAI Responses API

Key feature: Allowing LLM to solve problems with iterative tool usage

### Implementation Example with OpenAI Responses API

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { entityQueryTool } from '@/lib/neo4j-tools';

const result = await streamText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-4o'),
  prompt: 'What can you tell me about quantum physics?',
  tools: {
    // Custom Neo4j tool
    queryEntities: entityQueryTool,
    
    // Built-in web search tool from OpenAI Responses API
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearchPreview({
      searchContextSize: 'high'
    })
  },
  maxSteps: 5,
});
```

With the OpenAI Responses API, we get access to built-in tools like web search, which can be combined with our custom Neo4j tools.

## Choosing Your Approach

Consider:
- Flexibility vs Control
- Integration of built-in and custom tools

## Implementation Strategy for Neo4j Knowledge Graph Integration

For our goal of creating a system similar to OpenAI's Deep Research with both web search and graph search capabilities:

### Phase 1: Neo4j Tool Implementation
1. Entity Query Tool - Find nodes in the graph
2. Relationship Query Tool - Explore connections
3. Path Finding Tool - Discover paths between entities
4. Knowledge Exploration Tool - Expand from starting nodes
5. Entity Creation Tool - Add new entities to the graph
6. Thought Recording Tool - Store reasoning processes
7. Reasoning Chain Tool - Track multi-step reasoning

### Phase 2: Agent Layer Implementation with OpenAI Responses API

1. **Research Orchestrator Agent**
   - Coordinates overall research process
   - Determines when to use web search vs. graph search
   - Maintains high-level goals and progress
   - Utilizes the OpenAI Responses API's built-in web search

2. **Knowledge Graph Worker**
   - Specialized in formulating optimal Cypher queries
   - Understands graph schema and query patterns
   - Interprets graph results and extracts insights

3. **Memory Updater Agent**
   - Responsible for creating new nodes in the graph
   - Processes web search results from OpenAI Responses API
   - Analyzes information to create Thought and ReasoningChain nodes
   - Ensures connections between new and existing knowledge

4. **Analysis Agent**
   - Evaluates quality and relevance of findings
   - Synthesizes information across multiple sources
   - Generates coherent summaries and conclusions

### Web Search Integration

The OpenAI Responses API provides:
- Built-in web search capabilities
- Real-time internet access
- Source citations and references
- Configurable search context

This eliminates the need to build a custom web search tool and allows us to focus on:
1. Processing and storing web search results in Neo4j
2. Creating meaningful connections between web information and existing knowledge
3. Building reasoning chains that combine web and graph information

This two-phase approach allows us to build and test the fundamental Neo4j tools before integrating them into a more complex agent system that can build upon reasoning across the lifecycle of its relationship with the user.
